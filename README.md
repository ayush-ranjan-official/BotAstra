# BotAstra

Made an Arduino project which counts the human population inside a hall by counting the number of people entering and exiting the room; it also alerts if the population inside exceeds the allowed value in the view of Covid-19 protocols.


## Features
- It uses Arduino UNO microcontroller with two ultrasonic distance sensors, first to be placed at entrance side of gate and second at the exit side.
- First sensor counts the number of people coming in and second counts people going out. Our code performs relevent operations using the information.
